# Automated Medical Appeal Follow-Ups with Python

Automating Medical Appeal Follow-Ups with Python and AI
December 2024

Managing medical appeals is a critical but time-intensive process. This blog post introduces a streamlined solution using Python, OpenAI GPT, and Bland.ai APIs for automated follow-ups.

# Problem Statement
Healthcare providers need efficient systems to track the status of medical appeals, but manual follow-ups consume time and resources.

# Solution
We created a Python-based system that:

Generates Follow-Up Scripts using OpenAI GPT models.
Initiates Calls Automatically with Bland.ai APIs.
Retrieves and Logs Call Transcripts for compliance.
# How It Works
Environment Setup: Set up API keys for OpenAI and Bland.ai using a .env file.
Call Script Generation: The OpenAI GPT model dynamically crafts professional and personalized scripts.
Automated Calling: Bland.ai handles the voice call initiation and execution.
Logging Conversations: All generated scripts and responses are saved for review.
# Code Walkthrough
The generate_call_script() function leverages OpenAI GPT to create conversational scripts.
The initiate_call_with_blandai() function handles call setup via Bland.ai.
Conversations are logged into a file using the save_conversation() method.
# Conclusion
This integration saves hours of manual work and ensures that healthcare providers can focus on their patients instead of administrative tasks.

This repository demonstrates a Python-based solution to automate follow-ups on medical appeals using OpenAI and Bland.ai APIs.
